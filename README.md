# Car_Game_Python

- Repository: `Learning Python`
- Type of challenge:  `Learning new Possibilities`
- Duration: `1 day`

## My Project
This little Sunday project is a Car game with the help of pygame to get better at python and because those little projects are really fun.   
This project was done without tutorial with the help of the projects that I had done before. 

## Instructions to test the game
- Open the 'Tetris_in_Python.exe' file
- Download it, accept the antivirus messages, trust me :) OR NOT.
- Then choose were you want to install the game.
- It will install a folder and in the folder there is a 'tetris.exe' file, open it.
- You might need to turn off the antivirus temporarily.
- You can then play tetris and you will surely beat my highscore of 175 ;)
